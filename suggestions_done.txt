FILE	LOCATOR	BEFORE_SNIPPET	AFTER_SNIPPET	NOTES
.gitignore	new file creation	(file did not exist)	Created Python/Jupyter .gitignore with __pycache__, .ipynb_checkpoints, venv, .env, *.csv, *.pth, history/	Prevents committing cache files, notebooks checkpoints, virtual envs, data files, model weights, and historian outputs
data/README.md	new file creation	(file did not exist)	Created data directory documentation explaining regularization_dataset.csv requirements and MNIST auto-download	Documents dataset requirements and expected file placement
NNTI_Assignment8_(Q8_3).ipynb	filename rename	NNTI_Assignment8_(Q8_3).ipynb	parameter_norm_penalties.ipynb	Professional descriptive name without assignment prefix
NNTI_Assignment_(Q8_4).ipynb	filename rename	NNTI_Assignment_(Q8_4).ipynb	neural_network_regularization.ipynb	Professional descriptive name without assignment prefix
parameter_norm_penalties.ipynb	cell[0] markdown	# NNTI Assignment 8 (Q8.3) **[Parameter Norm Penalties]**\n\nName 1: <br>\nStudent id 1: <br>...	# Parameter Norm Penalties (L1, L2, Elastic Net)\n\nThis notebook demonstrates various parameter norm penalty techniques...	Removed assignment title and student submission block; replaced with professional description
parameter_norm_penalties.ipynb	cell[3] code	from google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount('/content/drive/')	# Google Colab drive mount (not needed for local execution)\n# Uncomment if running on Google Colab:\n# from google.colab import drive...	Commented out Google Colab-specific mount code for portability
parameter_norm_penalties.ipynb	cell[7] code	load_data('/content/drive/MyDrive/University of Saarland/NNTI/NNTI_Assignment_8/Q8.3/regularization_dataset.csv') #Change file path as per requirement	load_data('data/regularization_dataset.csv') # Path relative to project root	Replaced absolute Google Drive path with relative project path
neural_network_regularization.ipynb	cell[0] markdown	# NNTI Assignment 8 (Q8.4)\n\nName 1: <br>\nStudent id 1: <br>...	# Neural Network Regularization Techniques\n\nThis notebook demonstrates modern regularization techniques...	Removed assignment title and student submission block; replaced with professional description
README.md	entire file	# NNTI Assignment 8\n\n**Project Type:** University Assignment/Task\n\nThis is Assignment 8 for the Neural Networks...	# Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques\n\n**Practical implementations of modern regularization methods...\n\n## Overview\n\nNeural networks are powerful but prone to overfitting...	Complete rewrite to portfolio-grade README with professional framing, comprehensive sections, setup instructions, troubleshooting, and aligned with project_identity.md
requirements.txt	line additions	torch>=2.0.0\nnumpy>=1.21.0\nmatplotlib>=3.3.0\njupyter>=1.0.0	Added: torchvision>=0.15.0, scikit-learn>=1.0.0, pandas>=1.3.0	Added missing dependencies used in notebooks (torchvision for MNIST, sklearn for regression models, pandas for data loading)
