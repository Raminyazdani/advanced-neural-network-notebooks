Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | feat(config): Add GitHub configuration and issue templates

Added `.github/` directory with Copilot instructions and issue templates for professional project management.

Contents:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Guidelines for Copilot to assist with this project
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`: Issue template configuration
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/portfolio_git_historian.yml`: Template for portfolio-ready + Git Historian workflow

This completes the professional repository setup:
- Enables structured issue creation
- Provides context for AI assistants
- Maintains consistency in project management
- Ready for portfolio presentation

The repository is now fully portfolio-ready with:
- Professional documentation (README, project_identity)
- Clean code structure (notebooks renamed, paths fixed)
- Complete dependency management
- GitHub configuration for collaboration

Verified: .github/ directory created with Copilot instructions and issue templates. Repository is portfolio-ready.
