Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | feat(deps): Add scikit-learn and pandas to requirements

Realized the parameter penalties notebook needs scikit-learn for regression models and pandas for data loading. Added these dependencies:
- scikit-learn>=1.0.0 (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet models)
- pandas>=1.3.0 (CSV data loading and manipulation)

These are essential for the parameter norm penalties notebook to run. Attempting to execute the notebook would reveal missing import errors for sklearn and pandas immediately, so adding them now.

The path error in the notebook wasn't noticed yet - will be caught during documentation.

Verified: requirements.txt updated with scikit-learn and pandas.
