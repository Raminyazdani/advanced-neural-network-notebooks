Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | feat(deps): Add requirements.txt with core dependencies

Added requirements.txt with the essential dependencies for PyTorch and Jupyter development:
- torch>=2.0.0 (deep learning framework)
- numpy>=1.21.0 (numerical computing)
- matplotlib>=3.3.0 (visualization)
- jupyter>=1.0.0 (interactive notebooks)

These are the minimum dependencies needed to start implementing the notebooks. Additional dependencies (scikit-learn, pandas, torchvision) will be added as needed when implementing specific functionality.

Verified: requirements.txt created with core PyTorch/Jupyter stack.
