Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | feat(docs): Create data directory with README documentation

Created the `data/` directory with comprehensive documentation about dataset requirements, format, and placement.

The data/README.md includes:
- Explanation of required regularization_dataset.csv file
- CSV format specification (features and target columns)
- Placement instructions (put CSV in data/ directory)
- Note that MNIST is automatically downloaded by torchvision
- Instructions for users without access to the dataset

This provides clear instructions for users on dataset requirements and avoids fabricating any datasets (following best practices).

Verified: data/README.md created with complete dataset documentation.
