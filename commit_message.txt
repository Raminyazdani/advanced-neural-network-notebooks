Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | feat(fix): Fix torchvision version specifier for compatibility

Changed torchvision version specifier from `==0.15.0` to `>=0.15.0` to allow compatible newer versions.

This follows Python best practices:
- Use `>=` for minimum version requirements
- Allows pip to install compatible newer versions
- Prevents version conflicts with PyTorch updates
- More flexible for users with different environments

The exact version `==` is too restrictive and would cause installation failures when PyTorch 2.1+ is installed (which requires torchvision 0.16+).

Verified: requirements.txt now uses `torchvision>=0.15.0` with proper minimum version specifier.
