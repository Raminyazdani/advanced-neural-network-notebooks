Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | WIP(docs): Add initial README with project vision

Created a minimal README describing the project goals and planned contents. This establishes the project's purpose early: demonstrating neural network regularization techniques including parameter norm penalties (L1, L2, Elastic Net) and modern deep learning regularization (dropout, weight decay, early stopping).

The README contains:
- Project title and basic description
- Planned notebook contents (as "coming soon")
- Placeholder for setup instructions

This documents the project vision to guide development.

Verified: README.md exists with basic project description and structure outline.
