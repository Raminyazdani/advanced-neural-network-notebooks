Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | feat(init): Add .gitignore

Started the repository with a comprehensive .gitignore file to prevent committing cache files, virtual environments, data files, and model weights. This includes patterns for:
- Python bytecode and cache (__pycache__, *.pyc)
- Jupyter notebook checkpoints (.ipynb_checkpoints/)
- Virtual environments (venv/, env/, .venv/)
- Environment files (.env)
- Data files (*.csv, *.pth)
- Historian outputs (history/)

Best practice to add .gitignore first before any other files to avoid accidentally committing unwanted files.

Verified: .gitignore file created with appropriate patterns for Python/Jupyter projects.
