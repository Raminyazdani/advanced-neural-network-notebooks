Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | WIP(docs): Expand README with setup instructions and usage guide

Significantly expanded the README to include detailed setup instructions, tech stack description, and how to run the notebooks.

Added sections:
- Tech Stack (Python 3.8+, PyTorch 2.0+, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter)
- Repository Structure (file tree with descriptions)
- Setup instructions (prerequisites, installation steps, virtual environment)
- How to Run (starting Jupyter, opening notebooks)
- Data Requirements (where to get/place datasets)

This makes the repository more accessible to users by providing clear, step-by-step instructions. Documentation is being improved iteratively as the project matures.

Verified: README.md expanded with setup, structure, and usage sections.
