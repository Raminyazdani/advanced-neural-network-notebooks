Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | WIP(deps): Add torchvision for MNIST dataset

Added torchvision to requirements.txt since the neural network regularization notebook needs it to download and load the MNIST dataset.

However, made a mistake: used exact version specifier `torchvision==0.15.0` instead of minimum version `>=0.15.0`. This is too restrictive and will break compatibility with newer PyTorch versions that require newer torchvision versions.

This is a common mistake when adding dependencies - developers sometimes copy exact versions instead of using minimum version specifiers for better compatibility.

Needs immediate fix in the next step.

Verified: requirements.txt updated with torchvision, but using overly restrictive == specifier (needs fix).
