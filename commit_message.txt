Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | feat(docs): Add project identity document

Created `project_identity.md` to formally define the project's display name, tagline, stack, topics, and problem statement.

Contents:
- Display Title: Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques
- Repo Slug: advanced-neural-network-notebooks
- Tagline: Practical implementations of modern regularization methods for neural networks
- GitHub Description: Comprehensive Jupyter notebooks demonstrating parameter norm penalties and neural network regularization
- Primary Stack: Python, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn
- Topics/Keywords: neural-networks, machine-learning, deep-learning, regularization, pytorch, dropout, weight-decay, l1-regularization, l2-regularization, elastic-net, overfitting-prevention
- Problem & Approach: Addressing neural network overfitting through practical regularization implementations
- Inputs/Outputs: Dataset requirements and expected deliverables

This document establishes clear project identity for portfolio presentation and GitHub optimization.

Verified: project_identity.md created with complete project metadata and identity information.
