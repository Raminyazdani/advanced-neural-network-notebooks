Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | feat(fix): Fix data path to use data/ subdirectory

Corrected the data path in `parameter_norm_penalties.ipynb` from `regularization_dataset.csv` (root directory) to `data/regularization_dataset.csv`, aligning with the documented directory structure.

Changes made:
- Updated load_data() call to use 'data/regularization_dataset.csv'
- Removed Google Colab-specific path references
- Path now matches the data/ directory structure documented in README

This fix was discovered while documenting data requirements - a realistic pattern where documentation reveals implementation inconsistencies.

Verified: parameter_norm_penalties.ipynb now uses correct data/ subdirectory path, matching README documentation.
