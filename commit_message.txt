Ramin Yazdani | Advanced Neural Network Regularization Techniques | main | WIP(docs): Update README to document data requirements

Expanded README to describe the notebooks and data requirements. Added a Contents section explaining what each notebook demonstrates.

While documenting that data should be in a `data/` directory for organization, I realized the parameter_norm_penalties.ipynb notebook has the data path pointing to the root directory (`regularization_dataset.csv`) instead of `data/regularization_dataset.csv`!

This is a common discovery pattern: writing documentation helps catch inconsistencies in the implementation. The path needs to be fixed in the next step.

Verified: README.md updated with notebook descriptions and data/ directory mention. Identified path inconsistency.
