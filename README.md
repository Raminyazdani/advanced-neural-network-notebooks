# Advanced Neural Network Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring neural network techniques and regularization methods.

## Contents

### 1. Parameter Norm Penalties
Demonstrates L1, L2, and Elastic Net regularization using scikit-learn.

**File:** `parameter_norm_penalties.ipynb`

**Data Required:** `regularization_dataset.csv` should be placed in the `data/` directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

See `requirements.txt` for specific versions.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

More details to be added as the project develops.
