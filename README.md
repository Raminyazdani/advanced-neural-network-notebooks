# Advanced Neural Network Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring neural network techniques and regularization methods.

## Coming Soon

This repository will contain implementations of:
- Parameter norm penalties (L1, L2, Elastic Net)
- Neural network regularization techniques
- Practical examples using PyTorch and scikit-learn

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook

More details to be added as the project develops.
